This project consists of:
1. A **Flask API** for sentiment analysis using Vader Sentiment.
2. An **Express.js server** that acts as a middleware to interact with the Flask API.

I did not know what you meant by setup but i followed the instructions you provided in the 2 sessions to create two servers one on port 5000 for the model and one on 4000 for the backend
